## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

Last time, all-pairs shortest path problem and it's computational complexity.

*Bellman Principle* to finding shortest-paths is to use known shortest paths and build on them.

Consider graph G with vertices $V = \{1,…,n\}​$, obtain a subfunction $\texttt{shortPath(i, j, k)}​$ that returns the shortest path from $i​$ to $j​$ using only vertices from the set $\{1,2,…,k\}​$ as intermediate points.

Given this function, the goal is to find the shortest path from each $i$ to each $j$ using only vertices in $\{1,2,…,k+1\}$.

​	For each pair, shortest path could either:

		1. Path that only uses vertices in $\{1,…,k\}$
		2. Path goes from $i$ to $k+1$, then $k+1$ to $j$, which is a construction of the known shortest paths.

Floyd-Warshall algorithm does compute idea for $k=1, k=2,…$ until done. Find that it is $O(n^3)$. 



Now what if we don't want all-paris, but only distance from $s$ to all other vertices. 



## Breadth-First Search Algorithm 

Basic idea of BFS is to use initially known

0.   $s$ has distance 0 from itself, all other distances unknown
1.  Find all neighbors of $s$, which by definition have distance 1.
2.  Find all neighbors of those vertices but excluding those already visited.

*Basic Fact*: every vertex whose shortest distance from $s$ is $d$, has neighbor whose shortest distance is $d -1 $.
