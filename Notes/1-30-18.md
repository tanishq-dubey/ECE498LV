## Local and Global Properties

-   Number of edges correspond to vertex -> degree (local property)
    -   Degree of vertex $i$ is $k_i$ 
-   Chromatic number - smallest number of colors needed to color graph without adjacent colors (global property)
-   Bipartiteness (global property)
-   Clustering Coefficient (local property)
-   Subgraph distribution (local property)
-   Average path length  (local property)

### Degree and density properties of undirected networks

-   For undirected directed networks, $k_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{ij}$ 
-   If $m$ edges in network, then there are $2m$ ends of edges $2m = \sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i$ 
-   $m = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}k_i = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}\sum_{j} A_{ij}$
-   The mean degree $c$ is $c=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}k_i = \frac{2m}{n}$
-   Max number of edges in a network of size $n$ is ${n}\choose{2} $= $\frac{(n)(n-1)}{2}$
-   Density $p$ of a network is a fraction of edges actually present: $p = \frac{m}{{n}\choose{2}} = \frac{c}{n - 1}$
-   A network for which $p$ is constant as $n$ goes to infinity is dense
-   A network for which $p$ is 0 as $n$ goes to infinity is sparse, also if $c$ is constant as $n$ goes to infinity
-   Asympotic notions require a sequence of networks whic is fine theoretically, but bad practically some networks, like WWW, or internet do grow.
-   Some networks have verticies with the same degree: *regular graphs*, k-regular
    -   Infinite lattices

### Degree and density properties of directed networks

-   *In-degree*: number of incoming edges
-   *Out-degree*: number of outgoing edges
-   Recall $A_{ij} = 1$ if edge from $j$ to $i$
    -   $k_i^{in} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{ij}$
    -   $k_j^{out} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{ij}$
-   Number of edges $m$ is: $m = \sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i^{in} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} k_i^{out} = \sum_i\sum_j A_{ij}  $

### Degree distributions

-   Emperical Degree Distributions over all nodes: $P_k$
-   Power law: $f(x) = (\alpha - 1) \gamma^{\alpha - 1} x^{-\alpha}$
    -   Recognized informally by a striaght line on a log-log plot
    -   $P_k = k^{-\gamma}$ where $\gamma$ is the power-law exponent (allometric scaling)
    -   $\log P_k = -\gamma \log k$ so $\gamma$ is slope on log-log plot
    -   For a directed network in general: $\gamma_{in} \neq \gamma_{out}$
        -   $P_{k, in} = k^{-\gamma_{in}}$
        -   $P_{k, out} = k^{-\gamma_{out}}$

Since Degrees are non-negative integers: $k = 1,2,3…$ normalization to get empirical probablity: $\sum_{k=1}^{\inf} P_k = 1$

Let $P_k = Ck^{-\gamma}$, $C\sum_{k=1}^{\inf} k^{-\gamma} = 1$

So $C = \frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^{\inf} k^{-\gamma}} = \frac{1}{\zeta(\gamma)}$

Where $\zeta(\gamma)$ is the Riemann zeta function, so $P_k = \frac{k^{-\gamma}}{\zeta(\gamma)}$

-   Continous approximation
    -   In analytical work, often allow degree to be any positive value
    -   $p(k) = Ck^{-\gamma}$
    -   Normalize: $\int_{k_{min}}^{\inf}p(k)dk = 1$, so $C = \frac{1}{\int_{k_{min}}^{\inf}p(k)dk} = (\gamma - 1)k_{min}^{\gamma -1}$
-   Exponential: $f(x) = \lambda e^{\lambda\gamma}e^{\lambda x}$

### ML Estimation for Exponential Mean $\lambda$

Likelihood function from data

$L(\lambda, x_1, x_2, x_n) = \prod_{j = 1}^{n} f_x(x_i, \lambda)$

$= \prod_{j = 1}^{n} \lambda e^{-\lambda x_i} =  \lambda^n \exp(-\lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{n} x_j)$

Log-liklihood, so take logs:

$l(\lambda, x_1, …, x_n) = \ln (L)$

$=\ln(\lambda^n) + \ln(\exp(-\lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{n} x_j))$

$=n\ln(\lambda) - \lambda\sum_{j = 1}^{n}x_j$

$\hat{\lambda} = \texttt{argmax}_{\lambda}(\lambda, x_1, …, x_n)$

So take derivative and set to zero

$\frac{d}{d\lambda}(n\ln(\lambda) - \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{n} x_j) = \frac{n}{\lambda} - \sum_{j = 1}^{n} x_j = 0$

$\hat{\lambda} = \frac{n}{\sum_{j = 1}^{n} x_j}$

### Prefrential Attachment

Start with $m_0$ nodes with arbitrary edges (as long as connected so each node has at least one edge).

_Growtih_, preferential attachment

At each time step, add a new node with $m < m_0 $ edges that conenct the new node to $m$ nodes allready in the network.

Probablity, $\pi(k)$ that edge of network connects to node $i$ depends on degree $k_i$ as follows:

$\pi(k_i) = \frac{k_i}{\sum_{j} k_j}$
